Hello Co Dev;
this is the file we can use to communicate and set the structure of the project

Firstly i have made some folders under the app folder

APP
    Models // this folder is where all our models go..there is already a User Model here
    
Http
    Controllers //this is where our controller will be made...their would be sub-folders for specfic controllers
                //e.g. Auth, Wallet etc
    Middleware // handle our user sessions and authorization
    Resources  // where we put our different resoure as per what we return
    Validators // where we handle different validation of different post request
    
Database
    Migration // where we write and put our schema
